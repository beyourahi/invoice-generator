## Contribution Philosophy

Invoice Generator is a focused, single-purpose tool. Contributions should respect that scope:

- **Solve the problem at hand.** A bug fix does not need surrounding refactors. A new theme does not need a theme-switcher UI unless explicitly requested.
- **Prefer existing abstractions.** Before adding a utility, check `src/lib/` — the resolver, generator, and zip modules already cover the core pipeline.
- **No speculative features.** Implement what is asked, not what might be useful in the future. Three explicit lines beat a premature abstraction.
- **Type safety is non-negotiable.** TypeScript strict mode is enabled. No `any`, no loose casts, no suppression comments.
- **Zero comments in shipped code.** Code should be self-documenting through naming and structure. If the _why_ is truly non-obvious, one short inline comment is acceptable — nothing more.

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

| Tool                                                            | Minimum Version | Notes                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [Bun](https://bun.sh)                                           | 1.x             | Package manager and runtime           |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)                                   | 20.x            | Required by some Wrangler internals   |
| [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) | 4.x             | Installed as a dev dependency via Bun |
| Git                                                             | 2.5+            | Required for worktree support         |

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd invoice-generator
bun install
```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

This wipes `.wrangler/`, `.svelte-kit/`, and `bundled/`, reinstalls dependencies, runs `cf-typegen` and `format`, then starts the Vite dev server. The app opens automatically in your default browser.

> **Note:** The Vite dev server does not provide a Cloudflare D1 binding. Authentication will be silently disabled and all routes will treat the session as unauthenticated. Use `bun run preview` (Wrangler-backed) to test auth locally.

### Environment Variables

Authentication requires Cloudflare secrets. For local testing via `bun run preview`, create a `.dev.vars` file at the project root (this file is gitignored):

```env
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<random-secret>
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8788
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-google-client-secret>
```

Generate a random secret with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Never commit `.env`, `.env.*`, or `.dev.vars`.

### Database (D1)

Migrations live in `migrations/`. Apply once per environment:

```bash
# Local (Wrangler preview)
bun run db:migrate:local

# Remote (production)
bun run db:migrate
```

### Regenerating Cloudflare Types

After any changes to `wrangler.jsonc`, regenerate the worker type definitions:

```bash
bun run cf-typegen
```

### Clean Rebuild

If the dev server behaves unexpectedly, do a full clean:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/ .wrangler/ .svelte-kit/ && bun install
```

### Path Aliases

| Alias  | Resolves to | Used in                                      |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `$lib` | `src/lib/`  | Library files, stores, utilities             |
| `$src` | `src/`      | Route files importing from `src/components/` |

Never use relative paths from route files. Always use the appropriate alias.

## Architecture Guidelines

### PDF Pipeline (client-side only)

The entire PDF generation pipeline runs in the browser. No server actions, no API routes:

1. `builder.ts` assembles the HTML document string from the theme template and client data
2. `generator.ts` injects that HTML into a hidden off-screen `<iframe>`, waits for fonts, captures it with `html2canvas` at 2× scale, then writes to jsPDF
3. `zip.ts` collects all generated Blobs into a `fflate` `zipSync` archive

**Critical constraints:**

- PDF generation is sequential and blocking by design. Do not parallelize `generatePdf()` calls — concurrent canvas operations cause corruption.
- The iframe uses `position: fixed; top: -9999px; left: -9999px; visibility: hidden`. Do not change this. `display: none` prevents `html2canvas` from rendering.
- Token substitution uses `String.prototype.replaceAll` — not regex. Tokens are case-sensitive literals (e.g. `{MONTH}`).

### Store Pattern

Both stores use the factory function + `$state` closure pattern, exported as singletons:

- `session.svelte.ts` — ephemeral per-session state (clients, invoices, generation lifecycle)
- `fixed.svelte.ts` — persistent sender/bank data backed by `localStorage`

`fixed.init()` must only be called from `+layout.svelte`'s `onMount` (SSR guard). Never call it at module scope or inside `$effect`.

### Theme System

Themes are registered in `$lib/themes/registry.ts`. `ACTIVE_THEME_ID` is hardcoded — there is no runtime switcher. Adding a theme means implementing the `Theme` interface and registering it in the `themes` map.

### Authentication

Google OAuth via Better Auth is the only sign-in method. `emailAndPassword` is explicitly disabled. The server layer (`hooks.server.ts`, route server files) handles only auth session management — the PDF pipeline is unaffected by auth state.

### shadcn-svelte Components

Files under `src/lib/components/ui/` are auto-generated by the shadcn-svelte CLI. **Never modify them by hand.** Create wrapper components in other directories. Add or update components via:

```bash
bunx shadcn-svelte@latest add <component>
```

---

## Coding Standards

### Svelte 5 Runes (mandatory)

Use Svelte 5 rune syntax exclusively. Legacy `export let`, `$:` reactive statements, and `writable` stores are not permitted in component files.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	// Props
	let { client, onUpdate }: ClientCardProps = $props();

	// State
	let expanded = $state(false);

	// Derived
	let isValid = $derived(client.name.length > 0);

	// Effects — only for side effects with external systems
	$effect(() => {
		document.title = client.name;
	});
</script>
```

Use `onMount` for DOM/lifecycle work. Use `$effect` only when reacting to reactive state changes that must synchronize with an external system.

### TypeScript

- Strict mode is enforced (`tsconfig.json`). No `any`. No type assertions (`as T`) without justification.
- Use `import type { ... }` for type-only imports.
- Define all component prop types explicitly — never implicit.
- Use `cn()` from `$lib/utils` for conditional class merging.

### Tailwind CSS v4

Configuration lives entirely in `src/app.css` under `@theme inline`. There is no `tailwind.config.js` — do not create one.

```css
/* Correct — extend via @theme inline in app.css */
@theme inline {
	--color-brand: oklch(0.62 0.21 265);
}
```

- Never hardcode hex, rgb, or oklch values directly in class attributes.
- The design is dark-only. No light mode. All `--color-*` tokens are dark values.
- CSS variables for all colors — class utilities reference variables, not raw values.

### Arrow Functions

```typescript
// Correct
const generateAll = async () => { ... };
const getFileName = (client: Client) => `${client.name}.pdf`;

// Wrong — no function declarations
function generateAll() { ... }
```

### Formatting

| Setting               | Value                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Indentation           | Tabs                    |
| Tab width (`.svelte`) | 4 spaces                |
| Quotes                | Double                  |
| Trailing commas       | None                    |
| Print width           | 100 (120 for `.svelte`) |
| Arrow parens          | Avoid (`x => x`)        |

Run Prettier before committing:

```bash
bun run format
```

### Comments

Write zero comments in shipped code. If the _why_ behind a decision is genuinely non-obvious — a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, a workaround for a specific upstream bug — one short line is acceptable. Never write multi-line comment blocks or JSDoc in application code.

---

## Git Workflow

This project uses **git worktrees** for parallel development. **Never create branches.**

### Why Worktrees Instead of Branches

- Multiple contributors (or AI agents) can work on separate features simultaneously without stashing or checkout conflicts.
- Git history remains linear and readable.
- No branch management overhead.

### Working with Worktrees

```bash
# Start work on a new feature
cd invoice-generator
git worktree add ../invoice-generator-<feature-name>
cd ../invoice-generator-<feature-name>

# List all active worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree when the work is merged
git worktree remove ../invoice-generator-<feature-name>

# Clean up stale references
git worktree prune
```

Each worktree shares the same `.git` directory, so commits from any worktree are immediately visible to all others.

### Merging Work

Once your changes are validated (see [Testing and Validation](#testing-and-validation)), merge them directly into `main` from the worktree. There are no feature branch PRs in the traditional sense — submit your changes as a patch or merge commit against `main`.

---

## Commit Message Conventions

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

### Format

```
<type>: <short description>

[optional body — explains why, not what]
```

### Types

| Type       | When to use                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | New feature or capability                  |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                    |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring with no behavior change |
| `style`    | Visual or UI-only changes                  |
| `chore`    | Tooling, config, dependencies              |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes                      |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements                   |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                   |

### Rules

- Subject line: 50–70 characters, imperative mood ("add", "fix", "remove" — not "added", "fixes")
- Body: optional; explain _why_, not _what_
- One logical change per commit (atomic)
- Never commit `.env`, `.dev.vars`, or any file containing secrets
- The build must pass at every commit — no broken intermediate states

### Examples

```
feat: add ZIP download button to generation panel

fix: prevent canvas corruption when generating multiple PDFs sequentially

refactor: extract invoice filename logic into standalone helper

chore: remove unused gsap dependency
```

## Reporting Issues and Feature Requests

### Before Opening an Issue

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Confirm the problem is reproducible on the latest commit of `main`.
3. For PDF rendering issues, test across Chrome and Firefox — `html2canvas` behavior differs between browsers.

### Issue Content

A useful bug report includes:

- **Environment**: Browser, OS, Bun version, Wrangler version
- **Steps to reproduce**: Minimal, numbered, and precise
- **Expected behavior**: What should have happened
- **Actual behavior**: What happened instead
- **Screenshots or console output**: Attach where relevant

A useful feature request includes:

- **Problem statement**: What are you trying to accomplish?
- **Proposed solution**: How would you implement it?
- **Alternatives considered**: What else did you explore?
- **Scope consideration**: Does this fit within the tool's focused purpose?

Features that expand scope significantly (e.g. a theme switcher, multi-user workspaces, server-side PDF rendering) require explicit discussion before implementation begins.

## Pull Request Workflow

### Before Opening a PR

Run the full validation suite and confirm everything passes:

```bash
bun run format       # Auto-format all files
bun run lint         # ESLint validation
bun run check        # svelte-check TypeScript validation
```

No PR should be opened with failing lint or type errors.

### PR Checklist

Before marking a PR ready for review, confirm:

- [ ] `bun run lint` passes with no errors or warnings
- [ ] `bun run check` passes with no TypeScript errors
- [ ] `bun run format` has been run and changes are committed
- [ ] The build succeeds: `bun run build`
- [ ] No `.env`, `.dev.vars`, or secret values are committed
- [ ] No `tmp_screenshots/` or `.playwright-mcp/` directories are committed
- [ ] No `any` types or suppressed TypeScript errors introduced
- [ ] No legacy Svelte patterns (`export let`, `$:`) introduced in component files
- [ ] No relative imports from route files (use `$lib` or `$src` aliases)
- [ ] No modifications to files under `src/lib/components/ui/` (auto-generated)
- [ ] PDF pipeline remains entirely client-side (no server actions added to the generation flow)
- [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits format
- [ ] Each commit builds independently (no broken intermediate states)

### PR Description

Include:

- **What changed**: Brief summary of the modification
- **Why**: Motivation or issue reference
- **How to test**: Steps to verify the change manually
- **Screenshots**: For any UI changes, attach before/after screenshots

### Review Expectations

- Reviewers will check for adherence to the coding standards and architecture guidelines above.
- Feedback is focused on correctness, scope, and consistency — not style preferences that Prettier already handles.
- Address review comments with follow-up commits, not force-pushes.
- Once approved, the author merges.

---

## Testing and Validation

There is currently no automated test suite configured. Validation is done through the type checker, linter, and manual testing.

### Required Validation Steps

```bash
bun run check        # svelte-check — catches TypeScript errors and Svelte-specific issues
bun run lint         # ESLint — enforces code quality rules
bun run format       # Prettier — enforces consistent formatting
bun run build        # Confirms the production build succeeds
```

Run all four before every commit. Never commit a build that fails any of these.

### Manual Testing

For changes touching the invoice pipeline:

1. Start `bun run dev` and open the app.
2. Fill in sender and bank details in `FixedSenderPanel`.
3. Add at least two clients, each with multiple invoice entries across different months.
4. Generate invoices and verify:
   - File names match the format `invoice-{PREFIX}-{MMDD}-{YEAR}.pdf`
   - Invoice IDs match `{PREFIX}-{MMDD}-{YEAR}`
   - `{MONTH}` token substitutes correctly in service descriptions
   - Per-file download produces a valid PDF
   - ZIP download produces a valid archive with correct folder structure: `{ClientName}-{Year}-Invoices/`
5. Test with a single client and a single invoice entry as well.

For changes touching auth:

1. Use `bun run preview` (Wrangler-backed) with `.dev.vars` configured.
2. Verify the Google OAuth redirect flow completes successfully.
3. Verify that `/login` redirects to `/` when already authenticated.
4. Verify that `/` redirects to `/login` when unauthenticated.

### Adding Tests

When tests are added, use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) — it integrates with the existing Vite setup. Place test files alongside source files using the `.test.ts` suffix:

```
src/lib/invoice/resolver.test.ts
src/lib/invoice/builder.test.ts
src/lib/pdf/zip.test.ts
```

Priority test targets are the pure functions: `resolver.ts` (token substitution), `builder.ts` (ID/filename format), and `zip.ts` (archive path generation).

## Documentation Standards

### CLAUDE.md

`CLAUDE.md` at the project root is the authoritative reference for AI coding assistants. Keep it accurate and up-to-date when making architectural changes. Structure follows the template defined in the workspace-level `CLAUDE.md`.

### Code Comments

Ship zero comments by default. The only acceptable comment is one that explains a non-obvious _why_: a subtle invariant, a workaround for a specific upstream bug, or a hidden external constraint. Never describe _what_ the code does — that belongs in the names and structure of the code itself.

### agent_docs/

For extended technical references (invoice schema specs, theme development guides, PDF rendering edge cases), create an `agent_docs/` directory at the project root and add markdown files there. Do not bloat `CLAUDE.md` with deep reference material.
